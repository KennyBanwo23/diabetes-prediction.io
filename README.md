## DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle which is named as Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
It consists of 8 attributes of 768 female patients that are at least 21 years old.

## AIM OF THE PROJECT
To predict whether patients have diabetes or not using their medical attributes and to determine the model with the highest accuracy.

## DATA DICTIONARY
1. Pregnancies
2. Glucose
3. Blood pressure
4. Skin thickness
5. Insulin
6. Body Mass Index (BMI)
7. Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age

## MODEL EVALUATION
Four model evaluation techniques were implemented in which accuracy was chosen as the best measure. The techniques were:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1 Score

## PROCESS AND OUTCOME
Four machine learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes were used and Random Forest had the highest accuracy of 83%.
